Installation
============

This command should install :mod:`pymbolic`::

    pip install pymbolic

You may need to run this with :command:`sudo` if you are not in a virtual environment
(not recommended). If you don't already have `pip <https://pypi.org/project/pip>`__,
run this beforehand::

    python -m ensurepip

For a more manual installation, download the source, unpack it, and run::

    pip install .

This should also install all the required dependencies (see ``pyproject.toml``
for a complete list).

For development, you may want to install in `editable mode
<https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/development_mode.html>`__::

    pip install --no-build-isolation --editable .[test]

Why pymbolic when there's already sympy?
========================================

(This is extracted from an email I (Andreas) sent to Aaron Meurer and Anthony
Scopatz.)

So why not use :mod:`sympy` as an AST for DSLs and code generation? It's a good
question. As you read the points I make below, please bear in mind that I'm not
saying this to 'attack' sympy or to diminish the achievement that it is. Very
much on the contrary--as I said above, sympy does a fantastic job being a
computer algebra. I just don't think it's as much in its element as an IR for
code generation. Personally, I think that's perfectly fine--IMO, the tradeoffs
are different for IRs and efficient computer algebra. In a sense, pymbolic
competes much harder with Python's ast module for being a usable program
representation than with Sympy for being a CAS.

At any rate, to answer your question, here goes:

*   First, specifically *because* sympy is smart about its input, and will
    rewrite it behind your back. pymbolic is *intended* to be a dumb and
    static expression tree, and it will leave its input alone unless you
    explicitly tell it not to. In terms of floating point math or around
    custom node types that may or may not obey the same rules as scalars,
    I feel like 'leave it alone' is a safer default.

*   Pickling: https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/4297

    The very moment code generation starts taking more than a second or
    so, you'll want to implement a caching mechanism, likely using Pickle.

*   Extensibility of transformation constructs: sympy's built-in traversal
    behaviors (e.g. taking derivatives, conversion to string, code
    generation) aren't particularly easy to extend.  It's important to
    understand what I'm talking about here: I would like to be able to
    make something that, say, is *like* taking a derivative (or
    evaluating, or...), but behaves just a bit differently for a few node
    types. This is a need that I've found to be very common in code
    generation. In (my understanding of) sympy, these behaviors are
    attached to method names, so the only way I could conceivably obtain a
    tweaked "diff" would be to temporarily monkeypatch "diff" for my node
    type, which is kind of a nonstarter. (unless I'm missing something)

    Pymbolic's "mapper" mechanism does somewhat better here--you
    simply inherit from the base behavior, implement/override a few
    methods, and you're done.

    This part is a bit of a red herring though, since this can be
    implemented for sympy (and, in fact, `I have
    <https://github.com/inducer/pymbolic/blob/main/pymbolic/interop/sympy.py#L47>`__).
    Also, I noticed that sympy's codegen module implements something similar (e.g.
    `here
    <https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/master/sympy/printing/fortran.py#L70>`__).
    The remaining issue is that most of sympy's behaviors aren't available to
    extend in this style.

*   Representation of code-like constructs, such as:

    *   Indexing

    *   Bit shifts and other bitwise ops:

    *   Distinguishing floor-div and true-div

    *   Attribute Access

*   I should also mention that pymbolic, aside from maintenance and bug
    fixes, is effectively 'finished'. It's pretty tiny, it's not
    ambitious, and it's not going to change much going forward. And that
    is precisely what I want from a package that provides the core data
    structure for something complicated and compiler-ish that I'm building
    on top.

        Be sure to mention the mix-in before the base class being mixed in the
        list of base classes. This way, the mix-in can override base class
        behavior.
